                        At the moment of creating this landing page I'm 26 years old.
                        I have no background in computer science but that doesn't stop
                        me from learning programming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-desc">
                        I was always known for my interest in computers but being honest I
                        was more into gaming than into computers from their technical side.
                        When I was really young, my aunt's friend taught me a few things in C++
                        but quickly dropped the idea of being my mentor as he had other stuff
                        to take care of in his life. My interest in coding slowly perished
                        only to be rekindled recently (beggining of 2023).
